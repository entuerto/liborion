   Notes

   The Max-Age Attribute:
   If a cookie has both the Max-Age and the Expires attribute, the Max-
   Age attribute has precedence and controls the expiration date of the
   cookie.  If a cookie has neither the Max-Age nor the Expires
   attribute, the user agent will retain the cookie until "the current
   session is over" (as defined by the user agent).

   The Path Attribute:
   If the server omits the Path attribute, the user agent will use the
   "directory" of the request-uri's path component as the default value.
   (See Section 5.1.4 for more details.)
